**Platforms &  Walls**
The platforms in the low-fidelity game uses a bump shader effect to give the pop to the bricks on the texture. This was done by using the in class Shader code for from the lecture 3
(Bump Mapping) and applying the texture's normal map and height map. This gave us the bumping effect but my platforms didn't look visually pleasing relative to the light source from the
bottom of the game level. To fix this I increased the slider to the max value being 10. This allowed the heightMap to show more of the vertex offset within the shader. This method was 
also used on the walls surrounding the platforms. My scene benefits from this shader beacuse of the directional and point lighting in my scene. With the main light sources coming from 
the lava, the bottom portion of the platform is well lit while the top has some lighting due to teh huge lava floor. This allows the heightMap to be used effectively as the partial light 
hitting the top platform can show the differences of vertex offset to the player clearly.
